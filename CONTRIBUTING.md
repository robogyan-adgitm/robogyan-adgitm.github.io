# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make sure your contribution is useful and relevant before submitting. That implies it has enough content and every item has a good succinct description.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `- [Repository Name](link-to-repository-label) _(label: beginner-friendly-label-in-the-repository)_ <br> Description`
- Example link formatting: `- [robogran](https://github.com/shyanukant/robogyan-adgitm.github.io/index.html/good-first-contribution) _(label: good-first-contribution)_ <br>  beginners-friendly projects.`
- Link additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should be given a meaningful title.
- Make sure to describe your pull request.
- If the label does not clearly state its "beginner friendly" purpose, please make sure to confirm with the maintainer that it is used for such issues. 
- Links must be pointing directly to the repository, no tracking links allowed. This list is not for advertising purposes.

Thank you for your suggestions!
